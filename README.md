# ShortOS

ShortOS is an experimental mini operating system made entirely inside iOS Shortcuts. This is version 0.0.1, the very first release.

⚠️ Note: This is extremely early-stage. Only basic features work. This is more of a playground for exploring ideas than a full OS.

# What Works in v0.0.1

BIOS: The core system interface is fully functional. You can boot into the BIOS and interact with it.

Filesystem Exploration: You can navigate the virtual filesystem and see how files and folders are organized.

Shutdown: Turn off the ShortOS environment safely.

Saving Data: Data you create or modify can be saved between sessions.

RAM Simulation: Explore how RAM works inside ShortOS.

Everything else is experimental or placeholder. No real “apps” exist yet.

#  How to Use

Open Shortcuts
 on your iPhone or iPad.

Download the ShortOS v0.0.1 shortcut from this repository.

Add the shortcut and run it.

Start by exploring the BIOS and navigating the filesystem.

# Why This Exists

ShortOS is an experiment to see how far iOS Shortcuts can go. It’s like building a tiny computer inside your iPhone, and this first release focuses on the foundation: booting, memory, and file management.
